## old way
```
git init --bare .d
```
then go to .d/config and make `bare = false` and `worktree = ..`  
then from `~` i can do `git --git-dir=.d status`


to work with magit, we need a text file `~/.git` that has `gitdir: .d` inside  
that makes git work in all subdirs, so its better not to have it there always
