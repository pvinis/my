With a PCRE engine, it matches white spaces, whereas, with a Oniguruma engine, it matches hexademical digit characters. Atom uses an Oniguruma engine, but github.com relies on a PCRE engine."},{"commit":"476abb10f572aeac0c4f905469c7f03f198310e0","date":"2017-05-27T20:49:39-05:00","author":"Michael Sheets","summary":"Remove invalid word boundary after #"},{"commit":"e88be21845912df5622854747117930b302df8fd","date":"2016-08-16T04:26:43-05:00","author":"Michael Sheets","summary":"Move folding rules into a settings item"},{"commit":"ec50f41a2eb307ca5b9ebba7b55e36bf74d62978","date":"2016-08-16T02:49:56-05:00","author":"Michael Sheets","summary":"Simplify description"},{"commit":"95a2d4c61e1680b3f779014289b396dd23a9c418","date":"2016-08-16T02:48:36-05:00","author":"Michael Sheets","summary":"Improve comment.line rule","body":"Use punctuation.whitespace scope and allow for injection into comment contents."},{"commit":"8844bb1151eb5db934ec5fd64399c7861614d7e8","date":"2016-08-16T02:47:04-05:00","author":"Michael Sheets","summary":"Remove completed review comments"},{"commit":"d1cfa864abc6e98178bd38a415e13af3b0ddf802","date":"2016-08-16T02:46:42-05:00","author":"Michael Sheets","summary":"TitleCase Instantiate commands"},{"commit":"2e8909d594707f2026b9624f31c6d22f19024362","date":"2016-08-16T02:44:53-05:00","author":"Michael Sheets","summary":"Numerous scope changes and improvements"},{"commit":"497c66d175bdbefe23e011957fed523037270e34","date":"2016-08-16T02:21:58-05:00","author":"Michael Sheets","summary":"Remove invalid escape sequence from regex"},{"commit":"979af6171493a34c938883a4527557c6512bb87e","date":"2016-08-16T02:16:16-05:00","author":"Michael Sheets","summary":"Rename template command"},{"commit":"17db9f651170c50e23e661502adebd52f3331684","date":"2016-08-14T22:55:33-05:00","author":"Michael Sheets","summary":"Cleanup mixed line endings"},{"commit":"66417521d8a00b4ea0016b0f7d695abcd561fd13","date":"2016-08-14T19:46:12-05:00","author":"Michael Sheets","summary":"Add readme"}],"name":"VHDL"}
